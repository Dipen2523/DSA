# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Repository

Welcome to my DSA Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. 🚀

## What's Inside?

📁 **Algorithms:** This directory contains implementations of classic algorithms such as sorting, searching, graph traversal, and more.

📁 **Data Structures:** Explore implementations of fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

📁 **Problem Solutions:** Dive into my solutions for specific coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.

## Why DSA Matters?

Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms is crucial for excelling in technical interviews, competitive programming, and real-world software development. Understanding these concepts helps in writing efficient, optimized, and scalable code.

## How to Use?

Feel free to browse through the directories and explore the code. Each problem solution is well-documented with explanations and time/space complexity analysis where applicable.

## Contributions

If you have suggestions for improvements, found a bug, or want to contribute your solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated! 🙌
