    "list is also a class. Looking at that documentation for list, you can see the methods that are contained therein, like list.append(). You can learn more in Python’s documentation of list.\n",
    "dict is also a class within Python. You can learn more in Python’s documentation of dict.\n",

    "Notice that hat = Hat() instantiates a hat. The sort functionality is always handled by the instance of the class Hat. By executing \n",
    "hat.sort(\"Harry\"), we pass the name of the student to the sort method of the particular instance of Hat, which we’ve called hat.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want, though, to run the sort function without creating a particular instance of the sorting hat (there’s only one, after all!). \n",

    "\n",

    "Notice how the __init__ method is removed because we don’t need to instantiate a hat anywhere in our code. self, therefore, is no \n",
    "longer relevant and is removed. We specify this sort as a @classmethod, replacing self with cls. Finally, notice how Hat is capitalized \n",
    "by convention near the end of this code, because this is the name of our class.\n",

    "Using @staticmethod may be something you might wish to explore. While not covered explicitly in this course, you are welcome to go and \n",
    "learn more about static methods and their distinction from class methods.\n",
    "Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is, perhaps, the most powerful feature of object-oriented programming.\n",
    "It just so happens that you can create a class that “inherits” methods, variables, and attributes from another class.\n",

    "Inheritance and Exceptions\n",
    "While we have just introduced inheritance, we have been using this all along during our use of exceptions.\n",
